Command Line Ruby Flashcards
============================
This was the first attempt at making flashcards for the Ruby core methods.  More than that, it was to help me to learn how to make command line apps.  The "database" for terms and definitions is a .txt file.

To run the app:
---------------
+ Clone the repo.
+ cd into the directory.
+ Type $ ruby flashcards.rb
+ Type your answer and hit enter to find out if you were correct or not.
